# 🌌 Solar System Animation

An interactive and responsive Solar System simulation built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was created to **brush up on core web development skills** and strengthen my understanding of layout, animation, and responsiveness using pure frontend technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- ☀️ Central animated Sun
- 🪐 Planetary orbits with accurate relative speeds
- 🌕 Orbiting Moon around Earth
- ✨ Dynamic starfield background
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – works smoothly on all screen sizes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tech      | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| `HTML5`   | Structure of the solar system     |
| `CSS3`    | Styling, animation, media queries |
| `JavaScript` | Dynamically creating stars     |

## 📱 Responsiveness

Media queries are used to **adjust the scale of the entire solar system** based on the screen size, ensuring that the layout fits well on:

- ✅ Desktops
- ✅ Tablets
- ✅ Mobile devices

---

## 🌠 How It Works

- Each planet and moon is a rotating `div` using `@keyframes orbit`
- Images are placed using `::before` pseudo-elements
- Starfield background is dynamically created with JavaScript
- Units are based on `rem`, and root font-size scales with media queries
